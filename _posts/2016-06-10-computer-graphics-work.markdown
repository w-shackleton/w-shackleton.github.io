I wrote some WebGL / Javascript demos for some coursework which I ended up
hosting on Github Pages.

## Simple demos

* [Draw a Bezier curve](/compgraphics/curve/)
* [Draw a triangle](/compgraphics/curve/)
* [Draw a tetrahedron](/advgraphics/tetrahedron.html)

## More interesting demos

I used [WebGL to render a Torus](/advgraphics/torus.html) - the interesting
thing here is that the input is a square grid of vertices which get wrapped
into a Torus in the vertex shader.

I also wrote a [Javascript raytracer](/compgraphics/raytracer/) which produces
a very well rendered looking result.

I [gave a
talk](https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr22/presentation/shackleton) at
[PEPR '22](https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr22) about my work at Meta to
safely, thoroughly and automatically deprecate products, their code and their
data.

> Heavily integrated products like social networks are composed of many
interconnected products and features. Over time, new features are built and
deployed, and eventually their usage can drop to a point where some of these
features need to be turned off and removed. Meta is establishing a set of best
practices and processes for deprecating products to ensure that these
operations are conducted safely and rigorously.

> This talk will address how Meta handles “Product Deprecation”, the process of
turning off an interconnected feature and deleting its code and user data
safely and automatically. Topics we will discuss include: how we automate
removal of dead data, why we need automated dead code removal as well, and how
we have provided engineers with tooling to understand how code and data are
being used to allow them to make decisions that unblock these automated removal
systems.

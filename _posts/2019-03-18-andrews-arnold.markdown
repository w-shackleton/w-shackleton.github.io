I recently moved flat in London, and I was quite reluctant to give up
Hyperoptic as my ISP. My new flat only has a VDSL line and so I went with
Andrews & Arnold, the UK ISP renowned for calling IPv4 the "legacy Internet"
and refusing to implement censorship technology.

This was a good move.

## Internet service

I've got a public IPv4 address and a /64 on IPv6; their account gives me a /48
should I so need it. I also get unfiltered, un-censored Internet access, and
2TB per month of traffic. This costs me Â£60 per month which is a fair bit more
than other "competitive" ISPs.

The service was installed by a BT OpenReach engineer which is standard across
most UK ISPs.

## Online accounts

AAISP really start to shine in their online accounts. Firstly, every account
has 2fac via Google Authenticator. Secondly, they have separate accounts for
billing and line configuration.

## Data insights

There's some nice graphs: certainly more detailed than my DD-WRT router gives
me:

I get emailed whenever the line goes down:

I can see the logs from the server(s) hosting their end of the connection:

The most fascinating piece of the line admin page for me is the log of the
line's transfer from the previous tenant's provider. Every message between A&A,
BT, TalkTalk and me is logged and is available:

## Summary

All in all I'm very impressed with A&A: as well as all the fancy buttons and
graphs and logs that make software people feel happy, the internet pipe is
absolutely stable: there's no 8pm bottleneck to be seen.

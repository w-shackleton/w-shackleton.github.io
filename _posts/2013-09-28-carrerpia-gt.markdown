Here’s a quick video of a current project of mine, the CarrerPIa GT. It’s a
remote controlled car with a Raspberry Pi inside to control the motor and
steering; the car is controlled from an Android phone, with a webcam feed from
the car.

The car is controlled using the PiFace breakout board and a bit of basic
circuitry, and the hardware side of a project like this is fairly basic. For
more info on how the car works, see the video!
I’ve put the source code for the
[car](https://code.launchpad.net/~w-shackleton/+junk/carrerpia-pi) and the
[phone](https://code.launchpad.net/~w-shackleton/+junk/carrerpia-android) on my
[Launchpad profile](https://launchpad.net/~w-shackleton).

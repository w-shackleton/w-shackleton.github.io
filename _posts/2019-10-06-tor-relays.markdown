For the past year I've been running five Tor relays! This is unrelated to my
[Tor work at Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-over-tor/making-connections-to-facebook-over-tor-faster/1729157350524311/)
and has been a great way for me to support Tor personally.

My relays can be found [on the Tor Relay Search
page](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:5FE3E497426DA9205BF4DAE1E4417C1DD6BC03DD).
